* Ether

/Ether/ is a low-level, general purpose systems
programming language that aims to improve on C.
C is already a (nearly) perfect language designed to 
be suitable for any purpose, but its power comes for
a price. /Ether/ improves on C's semantics by enhancing 
the runtime, testing and building support. 

/Ether/ also incorporates features of paradigms other 
than procedural without the implications of a slow runtime.
For other /Ether/ features, see the documentation.

** Features (bloat-free)

/Ether/ acts more like a toolset than a solution. It gives users
the ability to develop on a dynamic platform without compromising
ease of use. Features like 'compile-time code execution' and 
'evaluating expressions in an interpreter' are necessary to
develop high-quality and effient code.

+ compile-time code execution
+ stong static type system
+ built-in build-system
+ runtime type information
+ built-in testing support
+ ether-static interpreter
+ runtime checks in debug-mode
  + stack array bounds
+ concurrent and safe code execution
+ essential standard library toolset

** Installation

/Ether/ uses GNU make to automatically build the entire 
Ether platform. See *Dependencies* section for details.

**** Dependencies

+ gcc (or any other standard-compliant C compiler)
+ make (or nmake for /Windows/)

**** Windows / MacOS / Linux

#+BEGIN_SRC 
make -j8
#+END_SRC

After building, the relevent binaries can be found in 
the /bin// directory. 

*** Platform Support

Because of the way /Ether/ compiles native programs without
using a back-end like LLVM or Clang, it (for now) only 
supports 64-bit desktop platforms. 

** Example 

*** Hello World

#+BEGIN_SRC c
[deploy stdio]

[int: main [void]
    [putsl "Hello, world!"]]
#+END_SRC

*** Semantic features (brief)

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
[deploy stdio]
[deploy "renderer.eth"]

[struct entity
    [vec3 pos]
	[vec3 rot]
	[vec3 scl]
	[char* name]]

[static]
[void: entity_init [entity*:e]
    [e.pos = null]
	[e.rot = null]
	[e.scl = null]
	[putsl e.name]]

[void: entity_render [entity*:e]
    [renderer_submit e.mesh_comp]]]

[int: main [int:argc, char**:argv]
    [entity*:e]
	[comptime
		[assert [= [sizeof entity*] 8]]] ;; only 64-bit
	[entity_init e]
	[entity_render e]

[test "entity test"
    [entity:e = [entity_init]]
    [assert e]]
